.TH CRONTAB 1 "20 July 2009" "Marcela Mašláňová" "Cronie Users' Manual"
.SH NAME
crontab \- maintain crontab files for individual users
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B crontab
.RB [ -u
.IR user ] " file"
.br
.B crontab
.RB [ -u
.IR user ]
.RB [ -l " | " -r " | " -e ]\ [ -i ]
.RB [ -s ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Crontab
is the program used to install, deinstall or list the tables
used to drive the
.BR cron (8)
daemon.  Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in 
.I /var/spool/
, they are not intended to be edited directly. For SELinux in mls mode can be even 
more crontabs - for each range. For more see
.BR selinux (8).
.PP
The cron jobs could be allow or disallow for different users. For classical
crontab there exists
.I cron.allow
and
.I cron.deny
files.
If
.I cron.allow
file exists, then you must be listed therein in order to be allowed to use
this command.  If the
.I cron.allow
file does not exist but the
.I cron.deny
file does exist, then you must \fInot\fR be listed in the
.I cron.deny
file in order to use this command.  If neither of these files exists,
only the super user will be allowed to use this command.
The second option is using PAM authentication, where you set up users,
which could or couldn't use
.I crontab
and \fBalso\fR system cron jobs from
/etc/cron.d/.
.PP
The temporary directory could be set in enviroment variables. If it's not set
by user than
.I /tmp
is used.
.PP
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B "\-u"
Append the name of the user whose crontab is to be tweaked.  If this option 
is not given,
.I crontab
examines "your" crontab, i.e., the crontab of the person executing the
command.  Note that
.BR su (8)
can confuse
.I crontab
and that if you are running inside of
.BR su (8)
you should always use the
.B -u
option for safety's sake.
The first form of this command is used to install a new crontab from some
named file or standard input if the pseudo-filename "-" is given.
.TP
.B "\-l"
The current crontab will be displayed on standard output.
.TP
.B "\-r"
The current crontab will be removed.
.TP
.B "\-e"
This option is used to edit the current crontab using the editor specified by
the \s-1VISUAL\s+1 or \s-1EDITOR\s+1 environment variables.  After you exit
from the editor, the modified crontab will be installed automatically.
.TP
.B "\-i"
This option modifies the 
.B "\-r"
option to prompt the user for a 'y/Y' response
before actually removing the crontab.
.TP
.B "\-s"
It will append the current SELinux security context string as an
MLS_LEVEL setting to the crontab file before editing / replacement
occurs - see the documentation of MLS_LEVEL in 
.BR crontab(5)\.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
crontab(5), cron(8)
.SH FILES
.nf
/etc/cron.allow
/etc/cron.deny
.fi
.SH STANDARDS
The
.I crontab
command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (``POSIX'').  This new command syntax
differs from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as well as from the classic
SVR3 syntax.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
A fairly informative usage message appears if you run it with a bad command
line.
